					<h2>Welcome to Odin's World</h2>
					<p>This is a game about Odin's Ravens, who are sent to watch Odin's Lands:
					
					Raven Huginn - player 1 IMG - 
					Raven Muninn - player 2 + IMG
					
					</p>
					<p>They race each other around the world, heading through Land Cards in opposite directions, and the raven that reaches a full loop is the winner. + IMG OF THE LOOP!! </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Goal</h2>
					<p>Let the racing begin! The first player controlling their raven fly across all the lands cards completing the loop is the winner.</p>
					<p>Each player can also ask for some trickery help 
					from Loki that need to use wisely.</p>
					<h2>Each player have</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>1 dark or lighter Raven Coin + IMG</li>
						<li>X Fly Cards + IMG</li>
						<li>X Loki Cards + IMG</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Flying</h2>
					<p>To move a raven, the player must play a Flight Card from their hand, which 
					must match the corresponding Land Card displayed in front of their raven. Clicking 
					on the appropriate Land Card will move the raven as many Lands that match in a row.

					<h2>Trickery</h2>
					<p>Players have the option of drawing Loki Cards instead of Land Cards whenever 
					they have an opportunity to draw. Loki Cards can be played to manipulate the world,
					move either white or black raven forwards or backwards, or draw cards*. Once a Loki 
					Card is played, it is removed from the game.</p>
